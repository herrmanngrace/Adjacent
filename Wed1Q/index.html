    <p>I am taking this course because I hope to get a background in coding. 
      I do not have prior experience creating content for the web 
       (other than curating my instagram); however, I do have limited 
      experience with modeling tool R and Python. I hope to leave
       this program with a greater understanding of different programming 
      languages. </p>

      <p>JSTOR is an online library that contains resources. 
    They include, but are not limited to, academic journals, books, 
    and other primary sources. JSTOR is exraordinary because it provides 
    an insane amount of resources for people to access. It allows students 
    and those just willing to learn the opportunity to access their own evidence.
