        By scrolling he was able to find "staff" link. However, it was the
        council of economic affairs. He was unsure if this was the correct
        answer. Then he ended up in the cabinet. Each time he was positive he
        found it, but then was frustrated when it was not the right place.
        After going through multiple places he was confused about the direction.
        In the end we realized that the fault was on our end because having the
        staff directory would be a security risk, so in the future it would be
        important to narrow our question onto a specific department.
